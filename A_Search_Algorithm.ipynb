Therefore, a more helpful heuristic should account for such interactions. \n",

If such subgoals are disjoint, we can use the sum of costs as a new (and a better) admissible heuristic (Korf & Felner, n.d.). Manhattan distance is a special case of this idea where each set is a single tile. In order to precompute and store such costs, we can use the concept of memoization, i.e. the ability of computers to store the results of expensive function calls and to return the cached results when the same inputs occur again (Wikipedia, n.d.).
